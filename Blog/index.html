            While a classroom can never be totally replaced, the trend of self-study is picking up fast as well. According to a recent research, self-study, in addition to being more affordable and convenient, is surpassing classroom learning in terms of effectiveness.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are various self-study strategies you can follow at home to score better. One such easy and doable tip for every student is using whiteboards. Yes you read it right. Something as simple as using a whiteboard as a study tool can be very effective. Since most of you still prefer textbooks over online learning, using a whiteboard can be an excellent study tool and an easy learning style to adapt. So, get an erasable marker and draw the words you are studying. You can also make graphs to understand the concept better.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, if you are trying to learn a difficult maths concept, try to draw figures. If you cannot remember some important terms from biology or names from history, write just those terms on the whiteboard. You can even use different coloured markers. This will help you retain what you saw better. Also, certain things you can leave on the board for a day and look at it before going to sleep. It is said that the last thing you learn before going to bed has better retention than rest of the information you acquire over the day.
            <br>
            <br>
            With so many innovations in technology, self-study is something that has become feasible and enjoyable. Students are no longer confined to classrooms. Students of all ages find exploring a subject matter of interest or learning a new skill on their own time, and at a low cost, to be highly rewarding.
            <br>
            <br>
            Of course interaction is essential, but success comes when you understand that you have to anyway achieve your target alone, so why not make it easy. This study hack is quite useful for everyone, especially for those who think in pictures.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using such strategies will help you learn quicker. Self-studying is an excellent way to showcase your curiosity when applying to colleges be it graduation or post-graduation courses. Most of the colleges anyway encourage self-study by assigning projects. This will help you develop intellectual independence and explore subject matter you personally find interesting.

            <h3>IBM's Watson AI System Could Improve Cancer Treatment</h3>
            <figure>

            IBM's Watson artificial intelligence system could help persons with cancer by providing a rapid, comprehensive report of the genetic mutations at the root of their specific disease and the therapies that target them, says an Indian-origin pathologist.
            <br><br>
            "We have to change our whole behaviour in looking at tumours. We are missing too much and too often treatment does not work for patients," said Ravindra Kolhe, breast and molecular pathologist at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University in the US.
            <br><br>
            "With Watson, all oncogenes become targets," said Kolhe, who is giving an update on Watson Genomic Analysis during the international Cancer Genomics Consortium being held in Denver from August 7-9.
            <br><br>
            As an example, today a pathologist would analyse a melanoma biopsy for a single variation of the BRAF gene, which is present in about 50 per cent of melanomas.
            <br><br>
            There are drugs that directly target that mutated gene but if they do not find BRAF, the patient will receive a more broad-spectrum chemotherapy regimen.
            <br><br>
            Watson, on the other hand, has the ability to rapidly identify multiple variations in BRAF along with variations in nearly a dozen other genes known to contribute to the skin cancer as well as the therapies to target them, Kolhe said.
            <br><br>
            "The majority of the time, we just tell patients they have a cancer," Kolhe, an alumnus of Mahatma Gandhi Medical College in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, said.
            <br><br>
            "Watson can help us provide more comprehensive, personalised care to patients," Kolhe added.
            <br><br>
            Kolhe sequences DNA and RNA from a patient's tumour, feeds the information to Watson, a question-answering computer system that, unlike traditional search engines, can gather evidence and analyse data but also generate knowledge.
            <br><br>
            "In about 20 minutes, Watson looks at what is abnormal in the sample, then takes the abnormalities and looks all around the world to see what are the drugs already used against them, what studies are underway against them, even other drugs out there that might be useful," he explained.
            <br><br>
            Decisions about treatment clearly are still in the hands of physicians and patients, but Watson can make unprecedented information immediately available to make decisions about what treatment is best for an individual patient, Kolhe said.
            <br><br>
            As an example, as one of many test runs, Watson provided Kolhe a 30-page assessment of a patient with a rare soft tissue sarcoma, that included mutations on seven genes, where the mutations are, what they are known to do and options for targetting them.
            <br><br>
            There also was a list of gene alterations that have no known therapies as well as gene mutations that were present, but their contribution to disease aren't currently known.
            <br><br>
            It is those unknowns Watson comes across that might help researchers like Kolhe also identify new genetic contributors to a variety of cancers and make Watson a valuable scientific tool as well.
